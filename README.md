<b>Instructions</b>

In Space Shooter, you fly through space, shooting at incoming enemy spaceships.  But be careful, these spaceships have the ability to fire back.  And as you get passed each group and progress in the game, the spaceships will start to increase in size and move around.  Slide up and down to avoid their fire and tap the screen to shoot.  Make sure to destroy them before they destroy you!  Otherwise it's game over!
